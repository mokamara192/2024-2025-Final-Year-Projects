Detailed step-by-step guide to running a Django project.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have Python and `pip` (Python's package installer) installed on your system. You also need a virtual environment package.

1. **Verify Python Installation:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and type:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    If Python isn't installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install `virtualenv` (if not already installed):**
   If you don’t have `virtualenv`, install it by running:
    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

### Step 2: Extract the Zip File

1. Download the `ecom_prj.zip` file to your system if it’s not already on your computer.
2. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the zip file.
3. Right-click the zip file and choose **Extract Here** or use a tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR to extract it to a folder called `ecom_prj`.

Alternatively, in the terminal:

```bash
unzip ecom_prj.zip -d ecom_prj
```

Now, you should see the Django project files in the `ecom_prj` directory.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Using your terminal or command prompt, change your working directory to the `ecom_prj` folder:

```bash
cd ecom_prj
```

### Step 4: Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Inside the `ecom_prj` directory, create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    - On **Windows**:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On **macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    Once activated, you should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

### Step 5: Install Project Dependencies

1. **Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**
   The `requirements.txt` file should be included in your project directory. This file lists the Python packages required to run the project.

    Run the following command to install all dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Check for Missing Dependencies** (Optional):
   If there’s no `requirements.txt` or if some packages are missing, you can install packages individually. For example:
    ```bash
    pip install django
    pip install djangorestframework
    ```

### Step 6: Configure the Project Settings

1. **Check `settings.py`:**
   Open the `ecom_prj/settings.py` file in a text editor and ensure that all necessary configurations are correct.

2. **Configure the Database:**
   The default Django database is SQLite, so if you're using it, you won't need any additional configuration. However, if the project uses a different database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, ensure the settings are properly configured in `settings.py` under the `DATABASES` section.

    Example (for SQLite):

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Add Secret Key:**
   Ensure the `SECRET_KEY` is set in `settings.py`. If it’s missing, you can generate one:

    ```bash
    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"
    ```

    Then, replace the `SECRET_KEY` in `settings.py` with the generated value.

4. **Set Debug Mode (Optional):**
   For local development, you may want to ensure `DEBUG` is set to `True` in `settings.py`.

### Step 7: Apply Migrations

Django uses migrations to apply database schema changes. You need to run migrations to create the necessary database tables.

1. **Run Migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

This command applies all the database migrations to ensure the schema is up-to-date.

### Step 8: Create a Superuser (Optional)

If you need access to the Django admin interface, create a superuser account by running:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You’ll be prompted to enter a username, email, and password.

### Step 9: Run the Development Server

1. **Run the Django Server:**
   Now that everything is set up, you can run the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2. **Access the Website:**
   Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see the Django project running.

### Step 10: Access the Admin Interface (Optional)

If you created a superuser, you can log in to the Django admin interface by navigating to:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

Use the credentials you provided when creating the superuser to log in.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

-   **Error: Missing Module:**
    If you encounter an error about a missing module, simply install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install <module_name>
    ```

-   **Database Issues:**
    If you're using a database other than SQLite, ensure that you have the necessary database service running (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and that the connection settings in `settings.py` are correct.

-   **Static Files (Production):**
    If you deploy this project to production, make sure to collect static files by running:
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

Now you have successfully set up and run the `ecom_prj` Django project from a zip file!
